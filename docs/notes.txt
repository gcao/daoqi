TODO:

* set board size to 38*38, put a stone on any position will reflect on another 3 positions. !!!
* the master board(19*19) is in the middle, the virtual board should have slight
  different color. !!!
* change the way of handling dead stones !!!
* make it possible to change the size of the virtual board (low priority)
* improve score part, check correctness
* mark and remove a single stone
* mark and remove groups
* support undo
* make sure load/store works

* change the way of handling the virtual board:
the virtual board only affects the outlook, doesn't affect how it's stored in the SGF and how
the dead/live is decided
Board width and height of each stone need to be adjusted !!!
Board.update(i,j)
Board.update1(i,j)
Board.emptypaint()
Position.markrek(i,j,c)
Position.markrektest(i,j,c,ct)
only show users whose name contains "dqdq"
change InformationDistributor to ignore request from non-dqdq users

* make it support both Daoqi and Weiqi ?
* make virtual board adjustable (1..size)
* show/hide virtual board
* right click on board moves the clicked area to the center

Known issues:

* there's some problem with localizing Jago!
jagoclient/foreigh/JagoResource* should be copied to jagoclient?
can't display chinese characters in the menu!

Use Applet to show a game, to show moves etc.
Use AOP to ignore access control exception when used in an applet.
To debug Applet: http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.3/docs/debugging.html
To pass parameters from url to applet:
  use CGI script, generate the applet tag dynamically

CGI script:
retrieve a remote page (should contain a sgf file)
write to local temp dir
generate response containing <APPLET...>
create a mapping file
check mappings before retrieving remote page
see this: http://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~vparada/webcopy.html

Create an applet class to display a game on the same page.
show these buttons "|<", "<<", "<", ">", ">>", ">|", "Show numbers", virtual board adjusting slider.
take a url or relative path for input sgf
take a number that represents till which move it'll show initially  --- not necessary
take a number that represents from which move it'll show numbers.
take a number that represents virtual board width
take two numbers that changes the origin.

add full-screen mode  DONE!
see sample code here: http://javaalmanac.com/egs/java.awt/screen_FullWin.html

make both virtual board color and real board color adjustable! DONE!

bug: show target, when the mouse is on the right part of the board, the white rectangle is
not painted. DONE!

bug: when in full screen mode, all other windows should be hidden!  DONE!

bug: when a game is completed, another board window is automatically opened. this should be disabled.

bug: sometimes when a game is almost done, shou dan guan produces error "Illegal Move".
this is generated by IGS, there's no easy way to handle this yet!!! FIXED!

TODO: reorganize menu, group finish game operations in one menu, add resign command. DONE!

TODO: modify Jago to support applet to review go game.

TODO: write cgi and html page to store sgf into a file and return the location.

TODO: implement JiHuoZi rule, need to take care of ShuangHuo!

TODO: implement ZhengZi simulation

TODO: for now to use our own count method, we should not use pass/done to end a game, instead we should require
the losing side to resign!
First remove dead stones, then click "end game", if I lose, a "resign" command will be sent.

TODO: add ".sgf" to file to be saved. DONE!

TODO: make it possible to rotate the board
two parts:
  translate mouse operation positions to original board coordinates
  show original board in rotated way

To convert Chinese characters to unicode:
enter them in a text file, then run "native2ascii" to convert.

TODO: right click on the board doesn't recenter the board!
TODO: after rotated the board, left click doesn't work!

use projection:
rotate: 0/1/2/3
mirrorHorizontally
mirrorVertically
offsetx
offsety
virtualboardwidth


use aspectj to log
two good logging aspects can be found in below pages

TODO: comment all menu, button, toolbar items that don't apply. make it simple to use

TODO: create a startup class to open a simple logon window that allows user to connect to a server quickly

TODO: create a startup class that take host/port/user/password/language to directly connect to a server

BUG: open a url after opening a url for a while fails due to connection problem
	might be session related?

BUG: ConnectionFrame - the command history should be executed as is
BUG: ConnectionFrame - the command text field should not send empty shout command

TODO: implement messaging platform: compose/send/notification/read (does IGS support?)

TODO: put "Speak" in ConnectedGoFrame, use "say/kibitz" command in IGS, "kibitz" command in NNGS

TODO: the player keeps a list of prohibited moves, every observer will first ask for that when start
  observing a game. the player will also use kibitz to broadcast prohibited moves to all observers
  (use encrypted OOB)

TODO: move keylistener to the whole window instead of the board! do this for applet first.

TODO: 
copy games from apache public folder and clean up DONE
modify install script to copy games from local folder DONE 
modify game frame open dialog to default to DAOQI_HOME/games folder if it exists DONE
modify Defaults.java to set time to tournament default 40/20
remove some icons from the toolbar, hide "open qigame game" DONE
change timer to show B/W DONE
change igs game window's title to reflect who play as what(b/w) DONE
convert bat files to exe files (with icons) DONE

9 dqdq2 has run out of time
9 {Game 292: dqdq1 vs dqdq2 : Black forfeits on time.}

9 dqdq2 has resigned the game.
9 {Game 372: dqdq1 vs dqdq2 : Black resigns.}

stop timer after game ends. DONE
check IGS command for get times -- time  DONE
does time work for observer? does it take a game number?
stop timer if game ended after counting, add to comment area.
fix time/move display not updated

add command/say dropdown to GoFrame?
check whether Label supports multi line text? use it in BigTimerLabel
check whether a channel will be closed if the creator logs out, if not, create button for daoqi channel
pops up message box if connection is lost
