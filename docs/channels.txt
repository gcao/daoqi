==== help channel ====
Usage: channel [number] [title]
  Channels are a forum, or meeting place, where people are able to gather
  and communicate with each other. Channels should also be used for group
  discussions on a particular topic, rather than using the 'shout' command.
  You can only enter one channel at a time, and communicate only with
  members in the channel you have entered. All channels have a number, and
  some may have a 'title'. The available channel numbers are 1 - 98.
  *NOTE*   For using the channels, see:   help yell

     To see all the active channels, enter:   channel

  To give a 'channel' a 'title', you must be in the channel you wish to
  give a 'title'.  For example, if you are in channel 33, enter:

                   channel 33 title Discussion On 'Atropa belladonna'

  To enter a channel, create a new channel, talk to members in a channel,
  or exit from a channel, use the 'yell' command.    See:   help yell

  channel 1 is reserved for players with a 'p' (professional) rank.

==== help yell ====
Usage: yell \[number] <message>

  'yell' can be used for 3 purposes:
     1) create a new channel     *NOTE*   See:   help channel
     2) enter a channel  (The valid 'channel' numbers are 1 - 98)
     3) send messages only to members of the same 'channel' as you.

        a) To do either (1), or (2), enter:   yell \number
        b) To do (3), enter:   yell <your message>
        c) To EXIT from a channel, enter:  yell \-1
        d) 'yell' can be shortened to:  ;

    Examples:
     #> ; \23               <-- to enter or create a new channel
     #> ; \23 hello all     <-- sends 'hello all' to members in channel 23
     #> ; hello all         <-- once in a channel, you may delete the number
     #> 23 till: hello all  <-- this is what the members in channel 23 see:
                                  (channel number and who sent the message)
     #> ; \-1               <-- to EXIT from a channel
         ^--------------------- Note the space after the ';'.
